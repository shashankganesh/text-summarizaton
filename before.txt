
Gothic architecture is a style of architecture used for buildings in Western Europe during the Middle Ages. Gothic architecture started in the 12th century, and lasted until the 16th century. Important features of the style are pointed arches, ribbed vaults and flying buttresses.

Today, people associate the style mainly with cathedrals, churches, and abbeys, but it was also used for castles, palaces, universities, and some houses.

Today, many buildings still remain in that style. Smaller ones are thought to be very beautiful, bigger ones are often seen as priceless works of art.

In the 19th century, the Gothic style became popular again, particularly for building churches and universities. This style is called Gothic Revival architecture.
